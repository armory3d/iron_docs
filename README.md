Iron is a library for building ultra-portable 3D tools using [Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) and [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe). Based on deployment requirements, JavaScript/C++ can be used. It is powering [Armory](http://armory3d.org), but is structured to run stand-alone.

While it is possible to operate Iron directly by hand, it is heavily data based. Instead, the library is designed to be integrated in custom tooling which will feed the data. Iron will handle full rendering and content pipelines, but will not provide visuals (no predefined shaders & render-path) or interaction.

Tooling:
- [Haxebullet](https://github.com/armory3d/haxebullet) for 3D physics
- [Haxerecast](https://github.com/armory3d/haxerecast) for 3D navigation
- [HaxeUI](https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-kha) to build user interfaces
- [KodeStudio](https://github.com/Kode/KodeStudio/releases) as IDE
